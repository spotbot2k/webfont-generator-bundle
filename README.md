# Contao 4 Webfont Generator Bundle
Helps you to manage your self-hosted webfonts as an alternative to the Google fonts API.

## Why
As you might know, usage of Google Services is not fully cmplient with the new GPDR, so hosting your own fonts is safer. As a bonus you can quickly switch fonts and styles in your layout.

## What does work
* Generate and load font CSS
* Manage font styles (bold, italic etc.)
* Assign fonts to CSS selectors automaticly
* Tested on Contao 4.4.20

## What does not
* Copy and paste compleate font sets
* User permissions not tested

## TODO
* Unit tests to ensure stability on Contao 4.4, 4.5
* Translate (check german, add russian)
