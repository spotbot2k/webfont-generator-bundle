# Contao 4 Webfont Generator Bundle
Helps you to manage your self-hosted webfonts as an alternative to the Google fonts API.

## What does work
* Generate and load font CSS
* Manage font styles (bold, italic etc.)

## What does not
* Some font properties are ignored (like stretch, style and fallback)
* CSS will only be updated upon saving the layout, not the font itself

## TODO
* Add "use for" field, to assign fonts automaticaly
* Do more tests to esnure stability
* Add german and russian translation
